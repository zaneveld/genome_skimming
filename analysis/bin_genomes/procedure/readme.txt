This folder contains the procedures to process data in the ../input/ folder to produce outputs in the ../output folder.
Relevant apptainer instance definitions are in ../apptainers. The definitions but not the apptainers (e.g. .def but not .sif files) will be checked in.
To recreate the analysis, users can rebuild the apptainer from the definition as the first step of the procedure.
